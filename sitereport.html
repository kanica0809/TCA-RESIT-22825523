            <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>
            <p>When I first started learning web development, I was overwhelmed by the amount of information and the
                different technologies involved. However, as I continued to learn and practice, I started to feel more
                comfortable and confident in my abilities.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to debug code. It can be frustrating when your
                code doesn't work as expected, but through trial and error, I learned how to identify and fix issues.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, I feel that my web development skills have improved significantly over the course of this
                module.</p>

            <h2>Site Development Process</h2>
            <p>When developing this site, I started by sketching out some rough ideas for the layout and design. I
                wanted to create a simple, clean, and responsive site that showcased my work and provided information
                about my skills and experience.</p>
            <p>Once I had a basic design, I started coding the site using HTML and CSS. I used a mobile-first approach
                and focused on creating a responsive layout that would look good on all devices.</p>
            <p>I also spent some time researching and experimenting with different fonts, colors, and images to create a
                cohesive and visually appealing design. I looked at other portfolio sites for inspiration and tried to
                incorporate some of the design elements that I liked.</p>
            <p>Throughout the development process, I tested the site on different devices and browsers to ensure that it
                worked correctly and looked good. I also used validation tools to check that my HTML and CSS were
                error-free.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Reflective Discussion</h2>
            <p>Overall, I feel that this module has been a valuable learning experience. I've learned a lot about web
                development, including HTML, CSS, and Git/GitHub. I've also developed skills in problem-solving,
                critical thinking, and attention to detail.</p>
            <p>One thing that I found challenging was managing my time effectively. There were times when I struggled to
                balance my coursework with other responsibilities and commitments.</p>
            <p>However, I feel that I've made good progress and I'm proud of what I've accomplished with this site. I
                feel that it showcases my skills and experience well, and I hope that it will be a useful tool for
                connecting with potential clients and employers in the future.</p>

            <h2>Site Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>When designing this site, I wanted to create a professional and modern-looking portfolio that would
                showcase my skills and experience. I decided to use a minimalist design with a white background and
                black text, as I felt this would be clean and easy to read.</p>
            <p>For the typography, I chose the font family "Open Sans" as it is a clean and modern sans-serif font that
                is easy to read on all devices. I used different font weights and sizes to create visual hierarchy and
                emphasis where necessary.</p>
            <p>For the color scheme, I chose a palette of blue and orange, as I felt these colors complemented each
                other well and created a modern and professional look. I used these colors sparingly throughout the site
                to create visual interest and draw attention to important elements.</p>
            <p>In terms of layout, I used a mobile-first approach and designed the site to be responsive and accessible
                on all devices. I also used a consistent navigation menu and footer across all pages to create a
                cohesive user experience.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Changes and Improvements</h2>
            <p>Throughout the development process, I made several changes and improvements to the site based on feedback
                and my own testing. For example, I added more content to the "Work Experience" and "Site Report" pages
                to provide more information and context for users.</p>
            <p>I also made several design tweaks, such as adjusting font sizes and line spacing to improve readability,
                and adding hover effects to links and buttons to create more interactivity.</p>
            <p>In terms of technical improvements, I used validation tools to ensure that my HTML and CSS were
                error-free and accessible. I also added meta tags and other SEO elements to improve the site's
                visibility and ranking in search engines.</p>
